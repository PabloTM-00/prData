#Advanced Programming I. Exercise 3.1#
Unit 3. Exception management

Description of the exercise
In this exercise, we will learn to define new exceptions, both checked and unchecked, and the differences in the treatment and propagation of both (unlike unchecked exceptions, checked exceptions must be announced in case a certain method throws or propagates them, or otherwise the method is obliged to capture it).
